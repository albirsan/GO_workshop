# si-demo
This demo Repository provides simplified example use cases on how to develop an application for the IONOS Cloud. It demonstrates how to benefit from Kubernetes and the services provided by the Platform Framework team. In addition to provide code examples, it is supposed to be the foundation for Service Integration workshops in order to onboard new product teams.

Each use case is covered in one of the branches of this repository.
